<h3>About the project:</h3><br>
A rpgc management system. Its still at its infancy. Any contribution is highly welcomed. If you notice a bug, feel free to raise a issue.
<h3>Installation</h3>
Still working on making a jar file. So for now -<br>
1. Download the source code <br>
2. Go to the folder and right click to open command prompt. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-the-fastest-smartest-ways-to-open-a-command-prompt/">How to open command prompt in windows.</a><br>
3. now type -<br>
   <i>cd bin/</i><br>
   <i>java launcher.Main</i><br>

And the program should start!<br>

(Let me know if it works. If it does not, then wait for a few days as I find a way to convert it into a .jar file. This way, you can open it with just a click.)<br>
