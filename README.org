* About the project
A rpgc management system. Its still at its infancy. Any contribution is highly welcomed. If you notice a bug, feel free to raise a issue.
* Installation
Still working on making a jar file. So for now -
1. Download the source code 
2. Go to the folder and right click to open command prompt. [[https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-the-fastest-smartest-ways-to-open-a-command-prompt/][How to open command prompt in windows.]]
3. now type -
cd bin/
java launcher.Main

And the program should start!

(Let me know if it works. If it does not, then wait for a few days as I find a way to convert it into a .jar file. This way, you can open it with just a click.)
